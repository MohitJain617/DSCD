- The client reads the input from testing_input_client.txt file if MANUAL_TESTING = False in client.py else we need to give the inputs manually

- python testing.py 

> testing.py creates and runs the registry_server, replicas (N_Replicas in testing.py) and client in seperate terminals

> Note the DELAY_TIME variable in replica, that is basically to make Non-blocking evident as it adds delay after updating each replica.

> Time between each client query > n*DELAY_TIME (Time to update all the replicas)

> Currenlty the testing is hardcoded in the sense that for read and delete it uses the latest written uuid by the client. (self.uuids[-1])
